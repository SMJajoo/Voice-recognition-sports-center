# Voice-recognition-sports-center
The expanding popularity of voice interface is used here to reenact the feeling of conversation between virtual 
assistant of the Sports Centre and user. With thorough research and observations, multiple sports activities 
and many types of equipment have been added to this prototype such as activities like Basketball, Volleyball, 
Swimming and equipment like Climbing shoes, Netballs etc. This prototype is a conversational VUI where 
the system does not have to give any indicator to speak. And uses a more natural turn-taking approach.
